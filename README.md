oneformer-cog
=============

This is a Replicate Cog setup for the OneFormer model.


# How to run

You can build and run the cog locally by running the following command:

```
cog predict -i image=@./ADE_val_00000001.jpg
```

This should produce an output.png file in your working directory. The output.png that exists in this repo is a cached version of the output of the above command.
